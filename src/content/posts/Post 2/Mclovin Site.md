# History

<h3>

        McLovin Site
    </a>
</h3>

<p>This page was born during a late-night Discord session with my friend Fabs. He was browsing for a domain for his website, and after a while, he stumbled upon the domain mclovin.site for just $2. We decided to split the cost, and he bought it on the spot. That’s when he suggested we create a site as a tribute to the legend of fake IDs and pure confidence.</p>

<p>The idea behind the project is to build a McLovin-style Card Generator, so anyone who wants to can create their own ID inspired by the iconic Hawaiian McLovin card. It’s our way of celebrating a piece of pop culture that reminds us all to be a little bold and have a bit of fun.</p>
