# My Book

In a world that feels increasingly fast-paced and disconnected, my book, Reflejos del pasado: Valores que cambian el presente, seeks to explore the core values that once unified humanity. Many of these values—such as compassion, honesty, and a sense of community—seem to have faded with time. However, through thoughtful stories and historical reflections, I aim to show that these values are not lost. They live on, upheld by individuals and groups who remind us of the potential for good that still exists today.

This book is an invitation to rediscover what connects us as humans and to see examples in modern society that prove these values remain relevant. By highlighting both historical lessons and current real-world examples, I hope to inspire readers to reflect on their own lives and the impact they can have by embodying these values. After all, even the smallest acts of kindness or integrity can make a significant difference in today’s world.
