# About This Page
Welcome to my corner of the internet! I created this site as a space to share my thoughts, explore ideas, and simply express myself about the daily things I enjoy. Here, you’ll find a mix of UFC analysis, sneak peeks of my book, and—most importantly—a real and unfiltered look at MauroQ. Feel free to comment on anything you like; that’s the point of these posts—to build a community where everyone feels welcome to join the conversation.


# About MauroQ

If you’re on this page, you probably know me already, but if not, let me introduce myself. I’m Mauro Quesada Arias, though most people know me as MauroQ. I’m a 20-year-old from Costa Rica, currently in my third year of Electrical Engineering at the University of Costa Rica, focusing on energy production. I’m passionate about reading, studying, and learning new things. I created this site as a way to express myself and share a small dose of MauroQ with the world—a dose I believe everyone could use.


# Fun Facts:

- I’m currently writing a book titled Reflejos del pasado: Valores que cambian el presente.
- I’m developing a website about [McLovin](https://www.mclovin.site/) with my friend [Fabs](https://github.com/FabsCR)
